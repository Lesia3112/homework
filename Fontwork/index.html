        React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
        applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With
        React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well
        as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
        components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about
        React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in
        React Native.

      </div>
      <p class="content__text">
        React Native runs on <a href="#">React</a>, a popular open source
        library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most
        of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can
        get you started or can serve as a refresher course. <br><br> We‚Äôre going to cover
        the core concepts behind React: <br><br>
        <b>+ components.</b> The rest of this
        introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable
        creatures that need names and a cafe to work <br><br>
        <b>+ JSX.</b> React and React
        Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript
        like so: Hello, I am your cat!. The React docs have a comprehensive
        guide to JSX you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is
        JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a
        name for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside . <br><br>
        <b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. <br><br>
        <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of
        props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is
        like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling
        data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State
        gives your components memory!

      </div>
      <p class="content__text">
        TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has
        an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the
        text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be
        called when the text is submitted. <br> <br> For example, let's say that as the
        user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In
        this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the
        sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
